Our project, which is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution, aims to predict whether the client 
will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).

The data is made available for study purposes by Moro, Rita, Cortez (2012).

In this repository you can find Machine Learning analysis as well as the code for deployed model.
